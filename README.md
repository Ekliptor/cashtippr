It is written in PHP7 using the latest WordPress APIs and hooks.

## Features

This plugin is also available in the [WordPress plugin installer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cashtippr-bitcoin-cash-moneybutton-payments/).


## ToDos
* add BCH web payment buttons, mobile browsers with integrated wallets,...
* crawl crypto-fiat exchange rates and implement QR code tipping for currencies other than USD
* add generation of 1-time BCH addresses using xPub to add QR codes for paywalls too (in PHP only, so we need an API server supporting this)
* see the TODO comments in the source code for many more smaller things
